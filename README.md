This is a project in which I webscraped data off of the MLB website. I then made graphs based off of different hitting stats from the top hitters in the mlb. One example is the scatter plot that was on both homeruns and batting average. This was to see if the batting average dropped off if they hit more homeruns and vice versa. I also ran some statistical tests to determine if higher batting average meant a lower amount of homeruns.
